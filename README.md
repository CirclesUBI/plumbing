# plumbing

This repository is a collection of different scripts / small programs which have been used in the past to help with various automated "plumbing", maintenance or clean-up tasks. 

## Overview

* `90days` Run a script to issue UBI for all known Circles Tokens
* `relayer-invalid-tx` Clean up invalid transactions from the Relayer database

## Development

If you have anything interesting which might be useful for the future, create a new folder with the files, add a `README.md` in it to explain how to use your tools and add some notes here about it under *Overview*.
